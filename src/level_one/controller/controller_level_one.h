/**
 * @brief Handles post event (only next events) processing for level one tasks in the main application.
 * @details The level one controller for main is responsible for clearing out error and desktop request flags (ref
 * Flow_level.show_error_screen, Flow_level.show_desktop_start_screen). Since it does post event processing, it is
 * responsible for performing state transitions based on the events so any updates to flow_level and counter must
 * happen here. In case of a wallet selection, the information is copied to the wallet instance for application to work
 * with. The device state is also changed from ready to busy using mark_device_state(). The controller also disables
 * processing of new requests from desktop app (i.e., the listener_task is disabled by setting its priority to
 * LV_TASK_PRIO_OFF) for safety.
 *
 * @see flow_level, counter, wallet, increase_level_counter(), mark_device_state(), listener_task, LV_TASK_PRIO_OFF
 * @since v1.0.0
 *
 * @note New desktop requests won't be processed until the priority of listener_task is set higher. This should happen
 * in the level_one_task itself.
